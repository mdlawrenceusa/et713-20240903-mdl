                <h2>Name Origin</h2>
                <p>How did Ozone Park get its name? Well, when you think of the word Ozone, what might come to mind is the gas that makes up part of Earth's atmosphere. It consists of ground-level pollutants such as smog and industrial waste. So why place a word like Park next to it?</p>
                <p>When Ozone gas was first identified in 1840, no one really understood its harmful effects. People associated the word with clean, fresh air. The word became popular as people began advertising beaches and properties using the word "Ozone". So naming a neighborhood "Ozone Park", was to bring attention to the pleasant environment. Such a description drew families in.</p>
                <p><i>This image of a cigarette card read, "Ozone is present in the air at the sea-side."</i></p>

                <h2>More History</h2>
                <p>Ozone Park, a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, is located in the southwestern section of its borough. It is located in the Sixth congressional district.</p>
                
                <p id="leftp">It was founded in the 1840s, centered around an area known as Centreville Street and the Centreville Community Church. During the 1870s, there was an economic depression that caused New York City residents to look for better housing. In 1880, the New York service began on the <a href="#">Montauk Branch</a> and the <a href="#">Rockaway Beach Branch</a> from Long Island to Howard Beach in Queens. The Rockaway Beach Branch's Ozone Park station opened in 1883. Because of the name "Ozone", which promised clean air and no disease, people were drawn in. Ozone Park was called the "Harlem of Brooklyn" since Queens had not yet existed and Harlem was a thriving, bright Jewish-Italian neighborhood.</p>
